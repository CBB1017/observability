# Why Testing Matters: A Crucial Strategy for Reliability, Quality, and Productivity

## Introduction

"Why has our company experienced so many deployment issues in the past?"  
This document explains why adopting **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** is essential.  
We address repeated problems caused by library changes, missing test methods, and the limited coverage of QC/QA processes.  
Explore how to achieve both **software reliability** and **productivity** with TDD.

## Problem Definition: Our Current Situation

Deployment issues our company has faced include:
- **Unexpected functional errors** when libraries are updated
- Bugs occurring due to **missing test methods**
- Limited QC/QA coverage, leading to deployments without testing all scenarios
- Resulting in **workload overload** for developers and QA teams and a decline in trust

---

## Limitations of QC/QA

To manually or automatically verify all functionalities before deployment:
- Requires significant **time and resources**
- Maintaining **complete coverage** is challenging while adhering to rapid deployment cycles
- Preventing issues from occurring is more effective than fixing them after they arise

---

## Problems TDD Can Solve

**Core principles of TDD**:
1. **Write tests before problems arise**
    - Minimizes unexpected impacts when updating libraries or adding features
2. **Automated testing for rapid feedback**
    - Allows developers to instantly identify errors
3. **Securing test coverage**
    - Ensures all critical logic and edge cases are validated before deployment

---

## Advantages of TDD: Balancing Reliability and Productivity

1. **Reliability**
    - Guarantees quality through tests before code deployment
    - Prevents unexpected issues, increasing team-wide trust

2. **Productivity**
    - Initially slows development but reduces bugs and rework over time, boosting efficiency
    - Automates repetitive QA and developer tasks, saving resources

---

## Getting Started with TDD

1. Develop a habit of **writing tests before implementing features**
2. Start by **writing tests for existing code** to ensure coverage
3. Set up a **TDD toolchain**:
    - Testing frameworks: JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript), etc.
    - Code coverage tools: JaCoCo, Istanbul (built-in with Jest), etc.
    - CI/CD automation: Jenkins (with ITSM)

## FAQ

### Q1. "Does TDD really improve productivity?"
A. While there’s an initial learning curve, TDD maximizes team productivity by **eliminating rework due to bugs**. Using pre-existing test code is much faster than manually calling Postman or HTTP methods to verify functionality.

### Q2. "Doesn't writing tests take too long?"
A. It’s only time-consuming at the start. Over time, TDD habits lead to faster and safer code development.

### Q3. "What’s the difference between a testing framework and a code coverage tool?"
A. A testing framework helps write and execute test cases, while a code coverage tool measures how much of your project is covered by tests.

## Our Testing Framework of Choice: Jest

### **Why Jest?**
1. Fully integrates with Node.js
2. Easy-to-use syntax and powerful features
3. Fast test execution and built-in coverage reports
4. Supports mocking, snapshot testing, and more
5. Well-documented and supported by an active community

## Conclusion - To Laos Developers

### **ORM**
**Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**:
- Simplifies database operations
- No need to write queries for basic CRUD; changes in entity fields reflect directly in the database
- Tools like TypeORM or Prisma can be used to write database-related tests with Jest
- Reduces the need to manually inspect the database for data structures or relationships

### **TypeScript**
**JavaScript with Type Safety**:
- Improves code reliability by reducing type-related bugs
- Speeds up development by catching errors during compilation
- Enhances code clarity for team collaboration
- Minimizes the impact of changes by providing type definitions
- Facilitates safer refactoring
