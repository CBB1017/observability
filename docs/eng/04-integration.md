# Test Code and ITSM Integration Process

---

## Overview

The test code you write is not just a tool to ensure quality; it plays a crucial role in managing **business error handling** and the **operational deployment process**.  
This document explains how test code integrates with ITSM (IT Service Management) to be systematically managed and validated.

---

## Process Overview

1. **Test Code Creation**
   - Developers write **test code** during feature development to ensure the proper functioning of business logic and error handling.

2. **Storing Test Code Information in ITSM DB**
   - All test code is managed as a predefined list in the **ITSM DB**.
   - The ITSM DB stores metadata for each test code, including its ID, description, and expected results.

3. **Test Code Execution**
   - Test code is executed via Jenkins.
   - During execution, the test code list is retrieved from the ITSM DB to verify that all predefined tests have been executed.

4. **Result Validation**
   - Jenkins compares the test results with the ITSM DB test list to ensure all tests have been executed successfully.
   - If any test fails, the deployment process is halted.

5. **Integration with Operational Deployment**
   - Successful test results are incorporated into the operational deployment approval process.
   - Deployment proceeds only when all tests pass.

## Roles and Benefits

### Roles
- **Test Code**: Automated tool for validating functionality and error handling.
- **ITSM DB**: Centralized management and tracking of test code.
- **Jenkins**: Executes test code and validates results.

### Benefits
1. **Enhanced Test Code Reliability**
   - Centralized **management and validation** of test code minimize the risk of omissions or errors.

2. **Improved Deployment Stability**
   - Including test success in the deployment process ensures **stable deployments**.

3. **Centralized Test Management**
   - The ITSM DB enables systematic management and tracking of test code.

## Jenkins and ITSM Integration Workflow

```plaintext
1. Jenkins execution → 2. Retrieve test code list mapped to the project from ITSM DB → 3. Execute test code → 4. Compare and validate results → 5. Pass results to deployment process
